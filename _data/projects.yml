      text: The Juba Project, named after early minstrelsy's most famous and most unusual early practitioner, explores the phenomenon of white performers in blackface in Britain, both from a historical and a dramaturgical perspective. The website features a database that will allow you to trace the movements of performers around Britain from 1842-1852, a closer examination of some of the documents and one group of performers, a performance-practice site that will explore the responses of contemporary artists to the documents and traditions of minstrelsy, and information about a book of original essays on minstrelsy's traditions and legacy, edited by Juba Project Director Stephen Johnson.
